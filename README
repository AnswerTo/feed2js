README

This directory contains the latest release of the Feed2JS source code.

This information is for web site owners that would like to incorporate  Feed2JS technology on their own site.

This is provided as open-source under a GNU General Public License.

To run Feed2JS, you need a web server capable of running PHP. You will need to FTP files to your server, perhaps change permissions, and make some basic edits to configure it for your system. 

I give you this code, getting it to work is on your shoulders.
